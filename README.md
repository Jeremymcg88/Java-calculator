# generate password
## Purpose
This was created to generate a password between the length of 8 - 128 characters to include uppercase, lowercase, numbers and specials. If the criteria for "8 -128" is not met, it will return a window prompt to choose inside that perimeter. Once the the number criteria is met it will prompt and give the choice to choose between the five options. It will then display the password inside the text box.
